For PC with 4-cores processor you might want to harness each core to find the optimal path in a tree or graph. All cores share the graph, starting node and target node, but each uses different search algorithm. We utilized three cores to run the search algorithms and one core to emerge the elapsed time it takes for each core to reach the target node.
The used uninformed search algorithms are:
## Depth First Search (DFS.py)

## Depth Limited Search (DLS.py)

## Bridth First Search (BLS.py)
